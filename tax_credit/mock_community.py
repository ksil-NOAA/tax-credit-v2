"""Mock-community evaluation of taxonomy assignments.

Every function here works on in-memory tables, with no directory layout or
file-name conventions. It replaces the BIOM-on-disk workflow of the upstream
``mock_evaluation`` / ``eval_framework`` modules, which are not part of this
Tourmaline-integrated fork.

Inputs
------
counts
    ``DataFrame`` of read counts, one row per ASV (index = feature id) and one
    column per sample.
assignments
    ``Series`` of observed lineages from a classifier, indexed by feature id.
composition
    ``DataFrame`` of expected relative abundance, one row per unique lineage
    (index) and one column per mock sample.
asv_taxonomy
    ``Series`` of known (true) lineages, indexed by feature id.
ranks
    Rank names for positions in a lineage, e.g.
    ``["kingdom", ..., "species"]``. The *level* of a rank is its 0-based
    position, so with the default seven ranks species is level 6.

Lineage handling
----------------
``normalize_lineage`` is applied to every lineage, expected and observed:
whitespace around each rank is stripped, trailing ``NA`` / empty ranks are
dropped (internal ``NA`` ranks keep their position), and ``Unassigned``,
``Unclassified`` and ``No blast hit`` become the empty lineage.

At a given rank, a lineage is *resolved* if it has a name (not ``NA``) at
that rank. ``A;B;C`` is resolved at level 2 but not at level 3.

Metrics (per sample, per rank)
------------------------------
Taxon Accuracy Rate (TAR)
    |observed ∩ expected| / |observed|. NaN when no taxa are observed.
Taxon Detection Rate (TDR)
    |observed ∩ expected| / |expected|. NaN when no taxa are expected.
    Observed taxa are those above ``min_relative_abundance`` of the sample's
    reads; expected taxa are those with expected abundance > 0. By default only
    lineages resolved at the rank are counted on either side. With
    ``legacy_unresolved_taxa=True`` unresolved lineages count as taxa too
    (truncated lineages and ``Unassigned``), as in the original tax-credit.
Bray-Curtis
    Dissimilarity between expected and observed relative abundance at the
    rank. Unresolved lineages keep their truncated label (``Unassigned`` for
    none), so an ASV assigned only to genus matches an expected taxon only
    known to genus. No abundance threshold is applied.
Precision, Recall, F-measure (needs ``asv_taxonomy``)
    Each ASV's observed lineage is scored against its known lineage with
    ``framework_functions.evaluate_classification``, weighted by the ASV's
    reads in the sample: match = true positive, underclassification = false
    negative, over- and misclassification = false positive and false negative.
    ``ASV Precision`` / ``ASV Recall`` / ``ASV F-measure`` weight every ASV
    equally. ``*_ratio`` columns give the read-weighted fraction of each
    classification outcome. ASVs without a known lineage are left out.

    For every expected lineage resolved at each evaluation rank, reports
    whether the truncated lineage exists in the database:

    ``found``
        The lineage exists in the database.
    ``different_lineage``
        The name at that rank exists in the database, but under a different
        lineage (``database_lineages`` lists up to *max_candidates*). This is
        the signature of expected taxa written against another backbone.
    ``not_in_database``
        The name is not in the database at that rank at all. The database
        may simply lack that taxon, or the names differ between backbones.

    Returns ``(report, messages)``. *messages* flags differences in rank count
    and in rank-prefix style (``g__Name`` vs ``Name``).
